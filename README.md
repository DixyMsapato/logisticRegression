# logisticRegression
An implementation of logistic regression via gradient descent for binary classification. 

Python implementation of logistic regression on a small data set. The code takaes data in the form of a csv file and performs linear regression input: csv data file, formatted such that the dependent variable y corresponds to the first column of the csv file output: scatter plot of training data with the hypothethis line of best fit. We assume that the data set is linear here.
To get good results, it seems a learning rate < 0.001 is required for gradient descent. 

I've attached an example data set obtained from the Coursera Andrew Ng machine learning course
